## Introduction

This is a documentation to use this component library

```
yarn add react
```

## Decision

* Wide adoption and active community: React is one of the most popular and widely adopted JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. It has an active developer community, a large amount of resources and support, and is maintained by Facebook, which makes it a reliable and well-established technology.

* Reactivity and performance: React is a JavaScript library focused on reactivity, allowing the construction of highly interactive and responsive user interfaces. It uses an optimized rendering approach, where only the parts of the interface that need to be updated are re-rendered, resulting in efficient and fast performance.

* Componentization and reusability: React is based on components, which allows for the construction of a highly modular and reusable component library. Components can be easily composed to create complex interfaces, and component reusability can lead to increased productivity in UI development.

* Ease of maintenance: Using React in conjunction with Tailwind CSS can provide an easier maintenance experience. Tailwind CSS is a utility CSS class library that allows for quick and consistent styling of components. The classes are written in a configuration-style format, which makes the styling code easy to understand and maintain. Additionally, the component-based approach of React makes it easy to maintain individual components and reuse styles throughout the library.

* Flexibility and customization: Tailwind CSS offers a wide range of utility classes that can be combined flexibly to create custom styles for library components. This allows developers to customize the appearance of components according to the specific needs of the project without having to write complex custom CSS.

*  Ecosystem of tools and integrations: Both React and Tailwind CSS have a rich ecosystem of tools, libraries, and integrations with other popular technologies. This can facilitate development, testing, and deployment of the component library, as well as enable integration with other parts of the project, such as state management, build tools, and more.

**In summary, the choice of React and Tailwind CSS for building a component library can be justified by their wide adoption, reactivity, performance, componentization, ease of maintenance, flexibility, and integrations with other tools. These technologies can enable the development of a modular, reusable, and customizable component library, making it easier to create modern and efficient user interfaces.**
